A work in progress, revit-centric, object model and its conversion routines to and from speckle. Includes the following, in progress, object defintions: 

- GridLine
- Level
- Wall
- Floor
- Column
- Beam
- Shaft
- Topography
- FamilyInstance (from revit only) - covers all families without an explicit conversion routine (ie, doors)

- Room

These are early days and the following are not battle tested.
